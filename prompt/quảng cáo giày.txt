A breathtaking cinematic 3D ad for [PRODUCT]. Frame a **dramatic mid-motion shot** that captures its explosive energy in a single, frozen moment. The lighting is **bright and bold**, with **glittering reflective highlights** and **deep, pitch-black shadows** that shape the product. The scene is saturated with **dynamic, chaotic particles**—like shattered glass or exploding cosmic dust—that trail behind the product in a **hyper-detailed slow-motion blur**. The environment is a **surreal, surreal landscape** that reflects the core essence of the product (e.g., a crystal cave for the 'crispy' product, an ethereal neon cityscape for the 'energetic' product). The lqsneaker brand logo, meticulously constructed from the product's own elements, appears to be created from the motion itself. Below it, a **bold, minimalist slogan** is displayed in a sleek font that matches the dynamic energy of the scene. **16:9 aspect ratio** landscape images, **super detail**, **ultra-sharp focus** and **vibrant, bold colors** make for a striking, contagious image.
